# The Door
The Door is a __Raspberry Pi__ based project mainly developed in __Python__.

The core function of this project is to control the access of my building front door from a simple client application on my phone. To do so, I've elaborated a __Python__ server interacting between a client appication and a servo motor connected to the __Raspberry PI__. The server, acting as clients/requests handler, is listening on my local network and wait for a any connection request from any potential clients. When a connection is established, the server wait for commands comming from the client and check if those commands are as expected and if the client can perform any actions at this moment. If there is nothing wrong in the command received and the servo motor is not busy, the server execute the task safely and wait for another command. 

The server also have the job to make sure the motor is always put back into idle position when a client leave or when an unexpected event happen. This is an important part, because at the end it's my building front door that can be compromise here. 

The servo motor, in this project have a very important part, his role is to control the access of my building front door by simply pressing or not pressing the little button on my wall originally made for this task. To control the motor I've created a __Python__ class that does the job pretty well using the __RPi.GPIO__ lib.
